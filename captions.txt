I don't like how I have to click on effects and then drop shadow comes up. Like I like having drop shadow. Maybe just always being an option perhaps under maybe it's filled border and then drop shadow. And of course it's by default. It isn't there's nothing there, but perhaps you can start adjusting these. So anyways, I can like design that exactly how I want it.
But I did want to get your thoughts on that and if you had a good way to implement that so please let me know. Thank you.
